## About

The `mirror` directory is specified in `conf/debian-cd/CONF.sh` and refers to the
location in which `debian-cd` reads from a _local_ copy of a "complete" Debian package
repository. 


## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the `mirror`
directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image with
_default_ settings.

Mirrored Debian package repositories targeting `stable`, `testing`, and
`unstable` "releases" across `main`, `contrib`, and `non-free` "sources" can
easily consume over 100GBs. This _default_ directory is _always_ overridden with
the path to an existing local mirror by means of specifying the `MIRROR`
variable during `make iso` invocation.
