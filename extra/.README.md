## About

The `extra` directory is specified in `conf/debian-cd/hooks/disc_finish_hook.sh`
a "hook" script near the end of the `debian-cd` ISO image creation. Contents
(i.e. files & child directories) within the `extra` directory are included in
the final ISO image.


## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the `extra`
directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image with
_default_ settings. 

This _default_ directory is _often_ overridden with an existing directory containing
the desired contents by means of specifying the `EXTRA` variable during `make iso`
invocation.
