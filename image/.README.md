## About

The `image` directory is specified in `conf/debian-cd/CONF.sh` and refers to the
location in which `debian-cd` will store the resulting customised Debian image
ISO file.

## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the `image`
directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image with
_default_ settings.

The resulting Debian image ISO file can range in size from ~500MiBs to 10GiBs+
depending on the number of packages included in the installer plus the contents
of the `extra/` directory. The targeted `image` directory can be overridden by
means of specifying the `IMAGE` variable during `make iso` invocation.
