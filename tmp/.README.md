## About

The `tmp` directory is specified in `conf/debian-cd/CONF.sh` and refers to the
location in which `debian-cd` stores intermediary build files during customised
Debian ISO image creation.


## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the `mirror`
directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image with
_default_ settings.

The `seed-installer`'s reliance on bind mounts forces the use of `COPYLINK` in
`debian-cd` resulting in a larger intermediary build "stage". Typical disk
consumption is around the ~600MiB mark. Users can override the location of the
`tmp` directory by specifying the `TMP` variable during `make iso` invocation.
