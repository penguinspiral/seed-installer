## About

The `local/mirror` directory is specified in `conf/debian-cd/CONF.sh` and refers
to a location in which `debian-cd` reads from a _local_ private (i.e. _not_ the
official Debian GNU/Linux mirrored repository) APT package repository.

## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the
`local/mirror` directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer`
ISO image with _default_ settings.

Unlike the mirror Debian GNU/Linux repository the consumption of a private APT
package repository is _optional_. Targeting a private APT repository is done by
assigning the `LOCAL_MIRROR` variable to that of the "root" private APT
repository during `make iso` invocation. Usage also requires specifying the
corresponding public GPG key(s), refer to `local/keys/.README.md` for more
details.

The `debian-cd` utility expects a "well-formed" APT repository structure. Such a
structure can be generated dynamically with tools such as `reprepro(1)`. Further
