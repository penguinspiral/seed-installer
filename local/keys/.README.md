## About

The `local/keys` directory operates independently of the `debian-cd` utility. It
serves as a directory for holding public GPG key(s) that were used to sign
package lists for a _local_, private APT repository.

GPG Keys stored in this directory are copied into a preemptively created nested
directory structure such that package list verifications performed by `make
status` (within the `debian-cd` context) succeed. This implementation
circumnavigates the standard `debian-cd` configuration interface any may break
in future updates of `debian-cd`.


## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the
`local/keys` directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO
image with _default_ settings.

Unlike the mirror Debian GNU/Linux repository the consumption of a private APT
package repository is _optional_. Targeting public GPG key(s) used to sign a
private APT repository is done by assigning the `LOCAL_KEYS` variable to that of
a directory containing the public GPG key(s). Usage also requires specifying the
corresponding private APT repository URI, refer to `local/mirror/.README.md` for
more details.
