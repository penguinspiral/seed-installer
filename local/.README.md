## About

The `local` directory is intended to store child directories `mirror/` and
`keys/`. Together these child directories facilitate the usage of a private
(i.e. _not_ the official Debian GNU/Linux mirrored repository) repository for
including packages as part of the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image.

## Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the `local`
"parent" directory when building the customised Debian `seed-installer` ISO image
with _default_ settings.

This particular "top-level" directory only serves as a logical abstraction for
its child directories. The user would (optionally) reference _both_ the
`mirror/` and `keys/` sub-directories in the case whereby inclusion of packages
sourced from a private repository is desired.
